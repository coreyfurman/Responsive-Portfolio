      <p>Hello, my name is Corey Furman. I grew up in Rockville, MD, but now live in Cleveland, Ohio. I have my bachelors degree in Marketing Management from Grove City College and am currently working as the Senior Digital Marketing Coordinator for a construction products manufacturer. I was drawn to pursue a career in marketing through my passion for photography because I saw how an image can communicate such a powerful message. I have found that design plays a very important role in almost every marketing channel, and web design in particular has become a new found intrigue of mine. The company I currently work for is overhauling their website, and I have been working on the frontend design to improve the user experience and implement new marketing features. 
      <br/><br/>
      Even though my background is in marketing, I find my skills are better suited for being a web developer. I am currently enrolled in Case Western's Coding Bootcamp to pursue a career as a full stack web developer. Although I have no formal education in graphic design, I have picked up a proficient understanding of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I find these tools to be very useful when it comes to designing the UI and wireframes of the apps or websites that I am building. 
      </p>
