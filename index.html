      <p>My name is Corey Furman. I grew up in Rockville, MD, but moved out to Cleveland two years ago so I could be closer to my now wife. I have my bachelors degree in Marketing Management from Grove City College and am currently work as a Digital Marketing Coordinator for a construction chemicals company. My passion for photography led me to pursue a career in marketing because I saw the impact of communicating a message whether in word or imagery. The company I currently work for is overhauling their website, and I have been working with an agency to add new features, update the design, and make it responsive.
      <br/><br/>
      Even though my background is in marketing, I find that I am more geared towards the technology that aids marketing efforts. I am currently enrolled in Case Western's Coding Bootcamp to pursue a career as a web developer. Although I have no formal education in graphic design, I have taught myself many of the Adobe Creative Suite programs such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I find these tools very useful when it comes to wireframing and designing mockups for various user interfaces.
